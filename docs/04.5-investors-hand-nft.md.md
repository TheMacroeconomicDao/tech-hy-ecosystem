# "Investor's Hand" NFT Collection

## Overview

The "Investor's Hand" NFT collection is a set of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that provide special privileges and benefits in the VC/VG token ecosystem on Solana. These NFTs can be obtained by staking VC tokens or purchased on the secondary market, and they grant holders numerous advantages, including improved VG staking conditions and access to higher DAO levels.

## "Investor's Hand" NFT Collection Levels

The collection includes five main levels, reflecting different degrees of commitment to the project:

| NFT Level      | Description                | Multiplier | Staking Yield Effect | DAO Access         |
|----------------|---------------------------|------------|---------------------|--------------------|

## Ways to Obtain NFT Boosters

NFT boosters can be obtained in several ways:

1. **Level progression via VC token staking**:
   - Paper Hand (initial level): stake 1M VC tokens
   - Wooden Hand: lock additional VC tokens + burn Paper Hand NFT
   - Steel Hand: lock additional VC tokens + burn Wooden Hand NFT
   - Titanium Hand: lock additional VC tokens + burn Steel Hand NFT
   - Diamond Hand: lock additional VC tokens + burn Titanium Hand NFT

2. **Special distribution**:
   - Diamond Hand: also issued only to selected project partners
   - Angel Investor: presale participants with ≥ 50 SOL
   - Limited NFTs: via partner presale and launchpad platforms

3. **Secondary market**:
   - All NFT boosters (except Angel Investor) can be traded on marketplaces
   - When buying an NFT, all its privileges transfer to the new owner

## NFT Level Progression System

The "Investor's Hand" NFT progression system is based on stepwise development:

1. **Level sequence**:
   - To obtain a higher-level NFT, you must have the previous level NFT
   - Progression: Paper Hand → Wooden Hand → Steel Hand → Titanium Hand → Diamond Hand

2. **Requirements for upgrading to the next level**:
   | Current Level | Target Level | Additional VC Required | Staking Period | Action with Current NFT |
   |--------------|-------------|-----------------------|---------------|------------------------|
   | -            | Paper Hand  | 1,000,000 VC          | 30 days       | -                      |
   | Paper Hand   | Wooden Hand | 1,500,000 VC          | 60 days       | Burn                   |
   | Wooden Hand  | Steel Hand  | 2,500,000 VC          | 90 days       | Burn                   |
   | Steel Hand   | Titanium Hand| 4,000,000 VC         | 180 days      | Burn                   |
   | Titanium Hand| Diamond Hand| 6,000,000 VC          | 365 days      | Burn                   |

3. **Upgrade process**:
   - User initiates upgrade via the interface
   - System checks for previous level NFT
   - Required VC tokens are locked for the specified period
   - Previous NFT is burned
   - New higher-level NFT is generated

## Functional Capabilities

### Impact on VG Token Staking

Applying NFT boosters from the "Investor's Hand" collection during VG staking provides:

1. **Increased staking yield**:
   - Calculation formula: `Yield = Base_Yield * Booster_Multiplier`
   - Example: Paper Hand (1.1x) increases base yield by 10%
   - Example: Diamond Hand (2.0x) increases base yield by 100%

2. **Access to higher DAO levels**:
   | DAO Level        | VG Token Requirement | Required NFT     | Staking Period |
   |------------------|---------------------|------------------|---------------|
   | Investor         | 25,000-50,000 VG    | Steel Hand+      | 365 days      |
   | Launchpad Master | 50,000-70,000 VG    | Titanium Hand+   | 365 days      |
   | Partner          | >70,000 VG          | Diamond Hand     | 365 days      |
   | Angel            | any amount          | Angel NFT        | Unlimited     |

3. **Staking autocompounding**:
   - Weekly autocompounding for higher levels (Investor, Launchpad Master, Partner)
   - Daily autocompounding for Angel Investor NFT holders

### NFT Metadata

Each NFT contains the following metadata:

```json

- Boost multiplier (multiplied by 100: 110 = 1.1x, 125 = 1.25x, etc.)
- Usage flag for staking
- VG staking account address
- Admin creation flag
- Upgrade history (array with info about previous levels and upgrade dates)
- Total amount of locked VC for all upgrades
- PDA bump

#### Investor's Hand Collection State Account
Contains overall collection stats:

## Integration with Other Ecosystem Components

### Integration with VC Staking

1. **Obtaining the first NFT (Paper Hand)**:
   - User locks 1M VC tokens for 90 days
   - "Paper Hand" NFT (level 1) is automatically generated
   - NFT is sent to the user's wallet

2. **NFT upgrade process**:
   - User selects an NFT to upgrade
   - Locks additional VC tokens for the required period
   - The original NFT is burned (deleted forever)
   - A new higher-level NFT is generated and sent to the user

3. **After staking period ends**:
   - User can withdraw their VC tokens
   - NFT booster remains with the user and can be used for VG staking

### Integration with VG Staking

1. **Applying NFT booster for VG staking**:
   - User applies NFT booster during VG staking
   - Staking yield increases according to NFT multiplier
   - NFT is marked as "in use" and linked to the VG staking account

2. **After VG staking ends**:
   - NFT is automatically deactivated and can be used again
   - If NFT was sold before staking ended, the bonus remains unchanged

### Integration with DAO

1. **Access to higher DAO levels**:
   - Steel Hand NFT (or higher) + 25,000-50,000 VG → Investor level
   - Titanium Hand NFT + 50,000-70,000 VG → Launchpad Master level
   - Diamond Hand NFT + more than 70,000 VG → Partner level

2. **DAO registration check**:
   - DAO checks for required NFT ownership
   - DAO checks amount of staked VG tokens
   - Assigns appropriate DAO level

## NFT Booster Usage Examples

### Example 1: Wooden Hand NFT (1.25x multiplier)

```
Input:
- DAO level: Expert (4000-25000 VG)
- Base yield: 10% APY
- NFT booster: Wooden Hand (1.25x)

Calculation:
Final yield = 10% * 1.25 = 12.5% APY
```

### Example 2: Steel Hand NFT (1.5x multiplier)

```
Input:
- DAO level: Investor (25000-50000 VG)
- Base yield: 12% APY
- NFT booster: Steel Hand (1.5x)

Calculation:
Final yield = 12% * 1.5 = 18% APY
```

### Example 3: Diamond Hand NFT (2.0x multiplier)

```
Input:
- DAO level: Partner (>70000 VG)
- Base yield: 15% APY
- NFT booster: Diamond Hand (2.0x)

Calculation:
Final yield = 15% * 2.0 = 30% APY
```

### Example 4: NFT upgrade from Paper Hand to Wooden Hand

```
Input:
- Current NFT: Paper Hand (level 1)
- Already locked: 1,000,000 VC
- Additional required: 1,500,000 VC
- Upgrade lock period: 60 days

Process:
1. User initiates upgrade via interface
2. System checks for Paper Hand NFT
3. 1,500,000 VC is locked for 60 days
4. Paper Hand NFT is burned
5. New Wooden Hand NFT (level 2) is generated
6. New NFT is sent to the user
```

## Security

### Key Security Aspects
