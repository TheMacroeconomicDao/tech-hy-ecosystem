### 3.3. Program Contracts (Smart Contracts)

#### 3.3.1. LP Formation Program ("Burn and Earn")
- **Purpose**: Convert VC and SOL into permanently locked LP tokens, distribute VG tokens, and create NFT Fee Key.
- **Key Logic**:
  1. User provides VC and SOL.
  2. Program interacts with Raydium to create LP tokens.
  3. LP tokens are locked in `PermanentLockVault` (PDA).
  4. VG tokens calculated and transferred to user.
  5. NFT Fee Key is created and transferred to user.
- **Data Structures**:
  *(Omitted for brevity)*
- **API / Instructions (example)**:
  *(Omitted for brevity)*

#### 3.3.2. VC Staking Program (and "Investor's Hand" NFT management)
- **Purpose**: Manage VC staking and full NFT booster lifecycle.
- **Key Logic**:
  1. **Staking and Minting NFT**: User stakes VC, program locks VC and mints NFT.
  2. **NFT Upgrade**: User stakes more VC, burns current NFT, mints next-level NFT.
  3. **Unstaking VC**: After lock period, user can withdraw VC. NFT remains.
  4. **Admin Functions**: Mint special NFTs (Titanium, Diamond, Angel).
- **Data Structures**:
  *(Omitted for brevity)*
- **API / Instructions (example)**:
  *(Omitted for brevity)*

#### 3.3.3. VG Staking Program
- **Purpose**: VG staking for DAO, rewards, NFT booster usage.
- **Key Logic**:
  1. **Staking**: User specifies VG amount and optional NFT.
  2. **Tax**: Program calls VG Token contract, which withholds 10% tax.
  3. **Terms**: Staking period, DAO level, and bonuses determined by staked VG and NFT.
  4. **Booster Application**: NFT multiplier applied to stake/rewards.
  5. **Auto-compounding**: For certain DAO levels or >10,000 VG staked.
  6. **Unstaking**: User can withdraw VG (minus tax) after period or early (if allowed).
- **Data Structures**:
  *(Omitted for brevity)*
- **API / Instructions (example)**:
  *(Omitted for brevity)*

#### 3.3.4. NFT Fee Key Program
- **Purpose**: Manage NFT Fee Key creation and rewards.
- **Key Logic**:
  1. **NFT Creation**: Called by "Burn and Earn", mints NFT, sets level, saves metadata.
  2. **Reward Claim**: NFT holder claims, program calculates and transfers VG.
  3. **Share Update**: Periodic or triggered recalculation of shares.
- **Data Structures**:
  *(Omitted for brevity)*
- **API / Instructions (example)**:
  *(Omitted for brevity)*

#### 3.3.5. Governance Program (DAO)
- **Purpose**: Decentralized governance via staked VG token voting.
- **Key Logic**:
  1. **Realms Integration**: Create/configure realm in Realms protocol.
  2. **Proposals**: VG stakers (min. 10,000) can create proposals.
  3. **Voting**: VG stakers (min. 100) vote. Weight = staked VG. Voting period (e.g., 7 days), quorum (e.g., 30% of active VG stake).
  4. **Execution**: Accepted proposals executed via DAO Executor.
  5. **DAO Treasury**: Managed by voting, funded by 50% VG tax and donations.
  6. **Emergency Management**: Multisig for critical actions.
- **Managed Params (examples)**:
  - VG tax rate (5–15%)
  - VG tax distribution proportions
  - Burn and Earn formula coefficients
  - NFT Fee Key parameters
  - VC/VG staking terms
- **API / Instructions**: Mainly Realms protocol, plus custom for DAO Executor/treasury.
- **External Dependencies**: Realms protocol.

## 4. Key Mechanics — Summary

### 4.1. "Burn and Earn" Flow
User (VC + SOL) → [Raydium] → LP Tokens → [Burn and Earn: LP Lock] → User receives: VG Tokens + NFT Fee Key.

### 4.2. VC Staking and "Investor's Hand" NFT Flow
User (VC) → [VC Staking: VC Lock] → User receives "Investor's Hand" NFT.
User (existing NFT + extra VC) → [VC Staking: Burn old NFT, Lock extra VC] → User receives upgraded NFT.

### 4.3. VG Staking Flow
User (VG Tokens + optional NFT) → [VG Staking: VG Lock (with tax)] → DAO participation + rewards (with NFT boost).

### 4.4. VG Token Tax Collection and Distribution
Any VG transfer/stake/unstake → [VG Token Contract: 10% tax] → 50% to NFT Fee Key Pool + 50% to DAO Treasury.

## 5. External Integrations
- **Raydium**: For VC/SOL liquidity pools and LP tokens in "Burn and Earn".
- **Metaplex**: For minting, updating, and burning all NFTs (NFT Fee Key, "Investor's Hand").
- **Realms**: For DAO infrastructure (proposals, voting, treasury management).

## 6. Security Aspects
- All contracts must be thoroughly audited.
- Use PDA for key data and authority management.
- Strict signature and authority checks in all instructions.
- Validate all inputs to prevent misuse.
- Protect against common attack vectors (reentrancy, integer overflow/underflow, etc.).
- Restrict admin functions, use multisig for critical ops.
- Transparency of all contract operations and states.

## 7. User Interface (UI/UX) — Recommendations
A web interface should provide:
- **Token Management**: Balances, transaction history.
- **"Burn and Earn"**: Interface for providing VC/SOL, getting/locking LP, viewing VG/NFT Fee Key.
- **VC Staking**: Interface for staking VC, viewing stakes, terms, NFTs, NFT upgrades.
- **VG Staking**: Interface for staking VG, choosing NFT booster, viewing stakes, yield, claiming rewards, unstaking.
- **NFT Management**: View all user NFTs, attributes, list for sale.
- **DAO (Governance)**:
  - View active/completed proposals.
  - Create proposals (for eligible users).
  - Vote on proposals.
  - Track DAO treasury.
- Intuitive design, mobile-friendly, clear instructions and tooltips.
