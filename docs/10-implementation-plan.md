# Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for the TECH HY ecosystem, including smart contract development, testing, deployment, and integration with external services.

## Stages

### 1. Preparation
- Finalize technical specifications and architecture
- Form the development and audit teams
- Set up the development environment (Rust, Anchor, Solana CLI)

### 2. Smart Contract Development
- Develop VC and VG token contracts (SPL standard, tax logic)
- Implement "Burn and Earn" mechanism
- Develop staking contracts for VC and VG tokens
- Implement NFT Fee Key and "Investor's Hand" NFT collection
- Integrate DAO and governance logic (Realms protocol)

### 3. Testing
- Write unit and integration tests for all contracts
- Simulate on-chain environment using Anchor test framework
- Perform security audits and code reviews
- Fix vulnerabilities and optimize performance

### 4. Deployment
- Deploy contracts to Solana devnet for public testing
- Conduct bug bounty and community testing
- Deploy contracts to Solana mainnet after successful testing

### 5. Frontend and API Integration
- Develop web interface for all ecosystem components
- Integrate wallet authentication and transaction signing
- Implement API endpoints for token, staking, NFT, and DAO operations
- Set up real-time event monitoring (WebSocket)

### 6. External Integrations
- Integrate with Raydium for liquidity pools
- Integrate with Metaplex for NFT minting and marketplace
- Set up analytics and monitoring tools

### 7. Launch and Support
- Launch the ecosystem to the public
- Provide user support and documentation
- Monitor system performance and security
- Plan for future upgrades and ecosystem expansion
